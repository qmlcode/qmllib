What
====

``qmllib`` is a Python/Fortran toolkit for representation of molecules and solids
for machine learning of properties of molecules and solids. The library is not
a high-level framework where you can do ``model.train()``, but supplies the
building blocks to carry out efficient and accurate machine learning. As such,
the goal is to provide usable and efficient implementations of concepts such as
representations and kernels.

====
QML or QMLLib?
====

``qmllib`` represents the core library functionality derived from the original
QML package, providing a powerful toolkit for quantum machine learning
applications, but without the high-level abstraction, for example SKLearn.

This package is and should stay free-function design oriented.
